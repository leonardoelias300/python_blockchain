# python_blockchain
A simple python blockchain with a php wallet to easy use. This code can be used in games to prevent money dupe since it uses the blockchain technology (or something similar).

DISCLAIMER: ITS NOT AS SECURE AS BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN SINCE IT IS CENTRALIZED AND A SINGLE PERSON WITH ACCESS TO THE SCRIPT (BLOCKCHAIN_MANAGER.PY) CAN CHANGE IT!

This was an idea to use in a game to prevent in-game money duplication by glitch, SQL injection or any possible means of fraud, isolating the money from the database. The security can be improved by runing the blockchain in a container or another computer in the same network, and also all the structure can be splitted across many machines.

It is dependant of some libraries and to prevent errors, check if the Apache server also have the libraries since sometimes it can be isolated (Xampp needs the installation of the required python libraries to work as well) accessing the python_requirements_install.php page.
